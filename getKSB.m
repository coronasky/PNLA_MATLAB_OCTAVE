% [D I] = getKSB(d,depth,root)
% ----------------------------
%
% Calculates and returns a Kernel Subspace Basis, consisting of all partial
% derivatives from degree 0 up to degree depth. The maximum degree of the
% monomial base is d. All these vectors of differentiated monomials are
% evaluated in root.
%
% D     =   matrix, each column contains a partial derivative of a monomial
%           basis, evaluated in root
%
% I     =   matrix, each column contains the indices of differentiation of
%           the corresponding column of D, eg. I(:,5) = [1;1] means that
%           D(:,4) = Dxy.
%
% d     =   scalar, degree of the monomial base
%
% depth =   scalar, maximum degree of differentiation
%
% n     =   scalar, number of variables
%
% root  =   vector, point in n-space in which the vectors of D need to be
%           evaluated.
