% ----------------------
%
% Applies the (partial) differential operator on a polynomial base vector
% of degree 'd' and evaluates it with 'root'. Graded xelicographic ordering
% is implicitly assumed. Multiple differentiation is also supported, x
% should then be a vector which indicates in which order there needs to be
% differentiated.
%
% y     =   column vector, contains the evaluated polynomial base vector
%
%           d^n1x1 ... d^nnxn  |
%           ------------------ | 
%           dx1^n1 ... dxn^nn  |x = root
%
% d     =   scalar, degree of the multivariate polynomial base vector
%
% root  =   row vector, used to evaluate differentiated base with
%
% x     =   row vector, index of the variable to which the differentation needs
%           to take place,
%
%                d        d        d
%           1 = ---, 2 = ---, 3 = ---, etc...
%               dx1      dx2      dx3  
%               
%           when a higher order differentiation is required then x is a row
%           vector indicating the order in which the variables need to be
%           differentiated, eg. x = [1 1 2] means first a 2nd order
%           differentiation to x1, then 1st order differentiation to x2.

% EXAMPLE
% -------
%
% second order derivative to y (= Dyy) of degree 6
% evaluated in the point (2,3):
%
% diffBase(6,[2 3],[2 2])
%
% first 1st order derivative to y, then 1st order derivative to x (= Dyx),
% degree 4 and evaluated in (-5,9):
%
% diffBase(4,[-5 9],[2 1])
